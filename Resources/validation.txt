# This file determines the validation rules to be run each time the configuration changes. By default, this file only contains
# validation rules from the Vulkan specification, but rules can be removed or additional rules may be added by the user. Note however
# that undefined behaviour may occur if not adhering to the Vulkan specification.

# An expression consists of a config identifier A, a compare op, and a value or config identifier B
# A rule consists of a name, a reference in an opening <RULE> tag, and a body. It's body starts with an expression which defines the 
# requirement that must be met if all conditions are true. Next, it has an opening <IF> tag to define the start of all
# condition expressions. Within the <IF>, there are at least one expressions defining conditions. After the first expression,
# an <AND> tag or <OR> tag must precede expressions to define how the conditions combine. Finally, the IF and RULE tags are closed.
# Rules always check conditions in the order and manner the conditions appear in the rule. Therefore (A && B) || (C && D) would actually parse as
# (((A && B) || C) && D). The correct way to implement this is with multiple rules, one defining A && B, and one for C && D.

# Values may be numbers, boolean constants FALSE and TRUE, or an appropriate Vulkan enumeration name, e.g. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST
# Note that all values against the physical device limits are tested internally in the program and do not need to be added here,
# however stricter limitations could be applied here.
