# This file determines the validation rules to be run each time the configuration changes. By default, this file only contains
# validation rules from the Vulkan specification, but rules can be removed or additional rules may be added by the user. Note however
# that undefined behaviour may occur if not adhering to the Vulkan specification.
#
# An expression consists of a config identifier A, a compare op, and a value or config identifier B
# A rule consists of a name and a reference, then an expression, IF, and a second expression
# e.g. <"Topology", "Valid usage in VkPrimitiveTopology online specification", Topology NOT_EQUAL VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST_WITH_ADJACENCY IF primitiveRestartEnable EQUALS false>
#
# Values may be numbers, boolean constants false and true, or an appropriate Vulkan enumeration name, e.g. VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST
#
# See below for the list of compare ops
# NOT_EQUAL
# EQUAL
# LESSER_THAN
# LESSER_THAN_EQUAL
# GREATER_THAN
# GREATER_THAN_EQUAL
# 
# See below for the list of config identifiers
# VertexBindingCount
# VertexAttribCount
